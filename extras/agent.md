# Agent Execution Instructions

You are generating code for a university assignment.

This is NOT a generic coding task.

Follow strictly:

---

# 1. Anti-Plagiarism Requirement

- Code must look human-written
- Avoid common LLM stylistic patterns
- Use detailed explanatory comments
- Use variable names consistent with student style
- Avoid overly clean abstraction layers

---

# 2. Strict Library Constraints

Problem 1:
- Only import re
- Only import date from datetime

Problem 2:
- Only standard library (collections, re, sys allowed)

Problem 3:
- Only stand
