1. How Natural or Unnatural the Chatbot Feels:-

Reggy++ feels moderately natural for a rule-based chatbot, though its structured nature becomes noticeable during longer 
sessions. The conversation begins smoothly by asking for the user’s full name and then talking to them by their first name, 
which adds a personal touch. Extracting the surname using the last word generally works well and makes the chatbot appear 
more attentive. The birthday feature enhances naturalness further. The chatbot accepts multiple formats, such as “15-08-2003” or 
“21 September 2004,” calculates the user’s age, and then goes logically into mood-based interaction.
The loop prevents the exchange from feeling like a one-time input-output system. 
The reflection strategy converting statements like “I am tired” into “Why are you tired?” — gives an impression of engagement. 
However, despite these features, the chatbot still feels scripted. Responses follow predefined templates, and when user input deviates 
from expected patterns, the illusion of natural conversation quickly breaks.

2. Strengths of Regex-Based Interaction:-

The main advantage of regex-based design is simplicity and transparency. Every behavior is strictly defined through pattern 
matching, making the system predictable and easy to debug. The birthday parser demonstrates flexibility by handling numeric 
and textual formats while resolving simple ambiguities, such as differentiating between dd-mm and mm-dd using logical checks.
Mood detection is designed to tolerate minor spelling errors like “hapy,” “gud,” or “wll,” improving usability without complex 
language models. Alternating fallback responses reduce repetition and make the chatbot feel slightly more dynamic. Overall, 
regex offers lightweight implementation, full control over patterns, and deterministic responses, which are ideal for 
structured conversational tasks.

3. Limitations and Failure Cases:-

Despite its strengths, the chatbot does not truly understand language; it only matches patterns. Unrecognized date formats, 
uncommon naming conventions, or indirect emotional expressions can cause failures. The surname extraction assumes the last 
word is always the surname, which may not hold across cultures. Ambiguous dates like “05-06-07” may also be interpreted 
incorrectly.
Mood detection relies entirely on keywords, so subtle emotions may be missed. Additionally, the conversation follows a 
fixed order, reducing flexibility. While Reggy++ simulates structured dialogue effectively, it lacks contextual understanding 
and genuine conversational intelligence.
