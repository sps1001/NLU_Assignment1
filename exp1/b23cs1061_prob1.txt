Reflection on Naturalness

This chatbot demonstrates how regular expressions can simulate conversational intelligence through purely pattern-based logic. While interacting with it, the conversation feels structured but somewhat mechanical. The chatbot correctly identifies full names, extracts surnames, parses multiple birthday formats, calculates age, and detects mood even with minor spelling mistakes. These features create an illusion of intelligence, though the system only performs pattern matching underneath.

A key strength of this regex-based approach is its simplicity and transparency. The entire logic is rule-driven, making it easy to understand, debug, and extend by adding new patterns. The chatbot handles several date formats including numeric forms like dd-mm-yyyy, mm-dd-yy, and dd/mm/yy, as well as textual formats like "15 August 2003" or "21 Sep 2004", all without requiring any external libraries. The mood detection uses fuzzy regex patterns to tolerate common typos such as "hapy" for happy, "tyred" for tired, and "angri" for angry. This makes the system more robust than a simple strict keyword match would be.

However, there are clear limitations. The chatbot does not truly understand language — it only matches predefined patterns. If a user provides an unexpected sentence structure such as "I was born in August 2003", the system cannot extract the date properly. Similarly, ambiguous inputs like "okayish" or "not bad" may not be classified correctly. The regex rules also grow increasingly complex as we try to cover more natural variations of user input.

Another limitation is the rigid conversational flow. The bot follows a fixed path: name, birthday, then mood. It cannot dynamically switch topics, handle interruptions, or maintain long-term context beyond simple stored variables. There is no memory across sessions or ability to learn from past interactions.

Overall, the chatbot feels semi-natural but clearly rule-based. It demonstrates the practical strengths of regular expressions for structured information extraction while also showing why modern conversational systems rely on machine learning and deep learning for true naturalness, flexibility, and context awareness.
